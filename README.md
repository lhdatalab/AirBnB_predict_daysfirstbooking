# AirBnB predict days until first booking and customer revenue

AirBnB data for predicting the country of first destination is readily
available online (Kaggle). Can this same data be used to define/solve 
other problems or create new opportunities?

One idea for this project is to create a seperate project using the same data. 

<b>Note: This analysis does not include any 2020 data. Revenue projections were limited to the US</b>

Days until revenue collected (days until first booking) and sizing the revenue opportunity (US).

An approximate 50% conversion rate US and global customers.

Revenue collected in 6 months for new customers (kaggle data) - $0.21M (US) and $1M (global).

Annual revenue collected for new customers (AirBnB real world data, 2019) - $3.8 billions (US) and $14.8 billions (global).

Increasing conversion rates from 50% to 65% can lead to increase in $1 billion (US only) in revenue.

The main analytics (machine learning) observations from this project are:
    1. Missing values can skew the results
    2. Finding a way to change the number of variables (bias) and 
    observations (variance) with limited project resources
    3. Choice of model and metric using nonlinear algorithms
    4. How to handle unexpected results
        i. Transform output variable
        ii. Parameter tuning
